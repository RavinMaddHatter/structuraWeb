	<h2>2.User content and licence terms</h2>
	<p><b>2.1.</b> The User may upload and publish its own content with the User Account through STRUCTURALAB, in particular in the form of structure files (.mcstructure), and related images (.jpg, .png, .gif) and other information and files (hereinafter “Structura Documents”) and functions as a platform for dissemination of Structura Documents. The Structura Documents are considered to be user content under the STRUCTURALAB Terms and Conditions (hereinafter the “User Content”) and any and all conditions, warranties and limitations following from these STRUCTURALAB Terms and Conditions shall apply to them.</p>
	<p><b>2.2.</b> By uploading the User Content to STRUCTURALAB, the User grants to the Operator a non-exclusive, gratuitous licence for the reproduction and communication of the work to the public worldwide and for the duration of the proprietary rights to the work; the Operator may further grant the authorisations thus obtained to a third party in the form of a sublicence, especially for the purpose of operating and promoting STRUCTURALAB and other services of the Operator.</p>
	<p><b>2.3.</b> If the User uploads and publishes any Structura Documents through STRUCTURALAB, the User provides them to the Operator and offers services to other Users under the Creative Commons licence, some of the available variants of the GNU licences or BSD licence (hereinafter the “Free Licences”). The Operator does not grant any licence to the Users for the Structura Documents. The issue of Structura Documents through STRUCTURALAB represents a proposal to enter into a licence agreement under the selected terms and conditions of the Free Licence made by the User vis-à-vis other Users. The User acknowledges that the Free Licences are irrevocable after publication of the Structura Documents.</p>
	<p><b>2.4.</b> The User agrees to display Structura Documents through STRUCTURALAB only if the User has the necessary authorisation to do so and to further distribute or license the Structura Documents under the chosen Free Licence, and also thereby represents that the Structura Documents do not violate any rights, in particular intellectual property rights, of third parties. Furthermore, the User agrees to use the service to only display Structura Documents which do not serve as instructions for makeing items the possession or manufacture of which is restricted or prohibited by laws and regulations.

	<p><b>2.7.</b> The Operator points out that Structura Documents are created by the Users and are in no way inspected or tested by the Operator prior to their publication. Thus, the Structura Documents and the description and labelling thereof may contain factual, technical and formal inaccuracies or errors and therefore may in no way be deemed to be expert advice or statements. The Operator does not guarantee the quality or flawlessness of the Structura Documents and shall not be liable to the User for any damage incurred as a result of using them.</p>
	<p><b>2.8.</b> Paragraphs 1.4 to 1.6 of the Terms and Conditions shall apply to the full extent to the Structura Documents.

	<p><b>2.9.</b> STRUCTURALAB does not serve as data storage and the Operator does not guarantee to the User that the User Content will not be damaged, modified or deleted. The Operator shall not be liable to the User for any damage incurred as a result of the loss of uploaded data.</p>
	<h2>3.Final provisions</h2>
	<p><b>3.1.</b> In the event of breach of these STRUCTURALAB Terms and Conditions, generally binding legal regulations or good morals by the User, or even in case of mere justified suspicion of such a breach, the Operator reserves the right to restrict the User’s access to STRUCTURALAB or other STRUCTURA, or to suspend or completely cancel the User’s account without prior notice or any compensation.</p>

To the extent permissible under the applicable legal regulations, the STRUCTURALAB services are provided without any warranty.</p>
	<p><b>3.3.</b> These STRUCTURALAB Terms and Conditions may be unilaterally modified or updated by the Operator at any time. The Operator shall notify the User of a change hereto at least 14 days before the effective date of the new version, by publishing the new version on the Operator’s Website or by means of a message sent to the User’s registered e-mail address. The User may reject the relevant changes by deleting his or her User Account or by not using STRUCTURALAB. The valid and effective version of the STRUCTURALAB Terms and Conditions is always published on the Operator’s Website and the User is obliged to become acquainted with it from time to time. If the STRUCTURALAB user continues to use STRUCTURALAB after the effective date of the changes, it is deemed that he or she accepts the changes.</p>
	<p><b>3.4.</b> The legal relationships between the User and the Operator arising on the basis of these STRUCTURALAB Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America.

	<p><b>3.5.</b> Invalidity or ineffectiveness of a provision of these STRUCTURALAB Terms and Conditions shall in no way prejudice the validity and effectiveness of other provisions.</p>
